	abstract = {MetPy is an open-source, Python-based package for meteorology, providing domain-specific functionality built extensively on top of the robust scientific Python software stack, which includes libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and xarray. The goal of the project is to bring the weather analysis capabilities of GEMPAK (and similar software tools) into a modern computing paradigm. MetPy strives to employ best practices in its development, including software tests, continuous integration, and automated publishing of web-based documentation. As such, MetPy represents a sustainable, long-term project that fills a need for the meteorological community. MetPy’s development is substantially driven by its user community, both through feedback on a variety of open, public forums like Stack Overflow, and through code contributions facilitated by the GitHub collaborative software development platform. MetPy has recently seen the release of version 1.0, with robust functionality for analyzing and visualizing meteorological datasets. While previous versions of MetPy have already seen extensive use, the 1.0 release represents a significant milestone in terms of completeness and a commitment to long-term support for the programming interfaces. This article provides an overview of MetPy’s suite of capabilities, including its use of labeled arrays and physical unit information as its core data model, unit-aware calculations, cross sections, skew T and GEMPAK-like plotting, station model plots, and support for parsing a variety of meteorological data formats. The general road map for future planned development for MetPy is also discussed.},

However, colour maps that visually distort data through uneven colour gradients or are unreadable to those with colour-vision deficiency remain prevalent in science. These include, but are not limited to, rainbow-like and red–green colour maps. Here, we present a simple guide for the scientific use of colour. We show how scientifically derived colour maps report true data variations, reduce complexity, and are accessible for people with colour-vision deficiencies. We highlight ways for the scientific community to identify and prevent the misuse of colour in science, and call for a proactive step away from colour misuse among the community, publishers, and the press.},

	abstract = {MetPy is a collection of tools in Python for reading, visualizing and performing calculations with weather data. The space MetPy aims for is GEMPAK (and maybe NCL)-like functionality, in a way that plugs easily into the existing scientific Python ecosystem (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). So, if you take the average GEMPAK script for a weather map, you need to: - read data - calculate a derived field - show on a map/skew-T One of the benefits hoped to achieve over GEMPAK is to make it easier to use these routines for any meteorological Python application; this means making it easy to pull out the LCL calculation and just use that, or re-use the Skew-T with your own data code. MetPy also prides itself on being well-documented and well-tested, so that on-going maintenance is easily manageable. The intended audience is that of GEMPAK: researchers, educators, and any one wanting to script up weather analysis. It doesn't even have to be scripting; all python meteorology tools are hoped to be able to benefit from MetPy. Conversely, it's hoped to be the meteorological equivalent of the audience of scipy/scikit-learn/skimage.},

	abstract = {Visualizing the output of models that use unstructured meshes, such as the Model for Prediction Across Scales Atmosphere (MPAS-A), poses unique challenges. MPAS-A employs a variable-resolution hexagon-based mesh to accurately capture complex geometries and localized phenomena, offering more details where needed and less details elsewhere to reduce computational cost. While MPAS-A input and output data are stored in NetCDF format, their organization by mesh cells rather than regular latitude-longitude grids makes them difficult to visualize using conventional tools. While some tools support MPAS-A data, they often require preprocessing steps to convert the mesh into a more compatible format due to inherent limitations. To address this gap, we present MPAS-Viewer, a lightweight Python-based post-processing tool designed to be efficient, portable across systems, and easy to install with minimal dependencies. It supports both regional and global MPAS-A domains, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. MPAS-Viewer provides an accurate and user-friendly way to visualize MPAS-A data directly on its native mesh, faster compared to similar tools, enabling faster insights and easier exploration.},
